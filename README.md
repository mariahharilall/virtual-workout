# Workout 

## Overview

Over the pandemic, many found themselves turning to at-home workouts via Youtube for a safe alternative to the gym, but it can be difficult to keep track of which videos you've done/you plan on doing when creating a routine. 

Workout is a web app that will allow users to either follow pre-existing workout calendars from fitness Youtubers. Users will be able to check off the days/workouts they've done to keep track of their progress & create their own workout calendars. They will even be able to share said calendars with other users so multiple users may follow a calendar at once and see each other's progress. 


## Data Model

The application will store Users, Calendars and Videos

* users can have multiple Calendars (via references)
* each list can have multiple Videos (by embedding)

An Example User:

```javascript
{
  username: "someUser",
  hash: // a password hash,
  calendars: // an array of references to Calendars
}
```

An Example Calendar with Embedded Videos:

```javascript
{
  creator: // a reference to the User object that created the calendar
  users: // array of references to Users added to the calendar
  name: "7-day Workout Calendar",
  videos: [ // array of array of video objects 
    [{ name: "Arm & Back Workout", link: "www.youtube.com/...", finished: true},
    { name: "Leg Workout", link: "www.youtube.com/...", finished: false}],
    [],
    [{ name: "Arm & Back Workout", link: "www.youtube.com/...", finished: true}]
  ]
}
```
